### Architecture

Project depends heavily on Cloudflare's CDN. Everything is stored and served from CDN, even html pages. Of course, except for admin interface. When a page is edited in admin, we clear CDN cache for it's url and all the dependent urls.

This gives us a great benefit - our servers handle less than 10% of traffic, everything else is served from CDN.

### Deployment
Deployment is done automatically with GitLab CI (check `.gitlab-ci.yml`). There are 2 stages:

1. New commits in master are automatically deployed to staging server.
    * Build new docker image
    * deploy image to server
    * clean CDN cache
2. After manual confirmation in Gitlab, production deployment starts
    * deploy image to server
    * clean CDN cache
   
All the secrets are stored in GitLab

### Backup
Backup is created once a week with GitLab CI/CD Schedules.

- DB dump is copied to Dropbox.
